                However, I discovered that this trait was holding me back from making new friends and seizing opportunities for personal growth. Determined to overcome my shyness, I joined the Model United Nations club and was eventually chosen to represent France as a delegate. Through this experience, I gradually built up my confidence and developed a love for socializing with others. My hard work paid off when I was recognized with an award for <b>excellence in diplomacy</b>. As I continue on my journey of self-improvement, I am grateful for the chance to have pushed myself out of my comfort zone and become a more outgoing and confident person.
