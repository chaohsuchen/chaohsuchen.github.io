                Despite the persistent myths surrounding Computer Science, which often paint it as solely a department focused on coding, I was unsure if this major was right for me before starting college. However, as I began my studies in CS a year ago, my perspective was completely transformed through the diverse array of courses that I was exposed to in the department. These experiences allowed me to truly appreciate the depth and beauty of Computer Science, which I came to understand is not just about coding, but rather, it is about empowering us to bring our creative ideas to life. Through these courses, I have gained invaluable skills and confidence in my ability to materialize my ideas, and I am grateful for the opportunity to study in such a dynamic and enriching field.

                當提起資工系，多數人會認為資工系的學生只是在學程式，而我也曾因為這項原因，帶著懷疑與不確定進入了資工系。然而，我逐漸意識到資工系其實教會我的不僅是撰寫程式，更教會如何將想法優化，並且將其實踐於電腦之中。

                The ability to communicate with computers is an endlessly fascinating pursuit, and it is this passion that drives me to continually improve my skills in both front-end and back-end development. I am excited to join a tech company in the future where I can fully immerse myself in a culture of vision and advancement, using the incredible power of computer technology to achieve my goals and make a meaningful impact on the world. With hard work and determination, I believe that anything is possible and that I can, will, and must accomplish great things with the help of computers.

                我一直以來認為能與電腦溝通是一件有趣且令人著迷的事，而這也是我學習的動力來源，不論是前端或是後端。我也期待未來能在科技公司當工程師，當一個有理想與抱負的人。

                English holds a special place in my heart, particularly after participating in international camps and studying materials related to my major. It was then that I realized the true power of the English. It is a language serve as an intangible bridge that connects people and knowledge from around the globe. I am committed to continuing to improve my English ability and using it to build connections and exchange ideas with others.

                我熱愛因英文，尤其是在參加國際營隊與修讀資工相關的內容後，我理解到英文如隱形的橋樑，連接了世界的知識與人們。我也期待未來能繼續精進英文。

                Pursuing a Master's degree abroad is a dream that I am deeply passionate about, as I believe it would provide an opportunity to meet people from all corners of the globe and immerse myself in a diverse educational environment. I am eager to take on this challenge and see where it will take me, as I am confident that it will be a truly enriching and life-changing experience.
                <br><br>
                我期望能到國外修讀碩士，因為我相信除了擁有高度競爭的學習換境外，也能結交各國的朋友，更能體驗不同的教育環境。
