                Despite the persistent myths surrounding Computer Science, which often paint it as solely a department focused on coding, I was unsure if this major was right for me before starting college. However, as I began my studies in CS a year ago, my perspective was completely transformed through the diverse array of courses that I was exposed to in the department. These experiences allowed me to truly appreciate the depth and beauty of Computer Science, which I came to understand is not just about coding, but rather, it is about empowering us to bring our creative ideas to life. Through these courses, I have gained invaluable skills and confidence in my ability to materialize my ideas, and I am grateful for the opportunity to study in such a dynamic and enriching field.

                The ability to communicate with computers is an endlessly fascinating pursuit, and it is this passion that drives me to continually improve my skills in both front-end and back-end development. I am excited to join a tech company in the future where I can fully immerse myself in a culture of vision and advancement, using the incredible power of computer technology to achieve my goals and make a meaningful impact on the world. With hard work and determination, I believe that anything is possible and that I can, will, and must accomplish great things with the help of computers.
