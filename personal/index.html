            <p>
                I was like most of the studentsâ€”being an introvert. However, during the journey of growing, I found that this characteristic deter me from making friends and grabbing the opportunity to pursue a better self. Determined, I joined MUN and become the delegate of France. Gradually, I built up my courage and became a person who love to socialize with others, and, fortunately, I was credited with <q>the best diplomacy</q>. <br><br>

                    <p>Because of MUN, I had built up the wisdom to speak and interact with new friends without making the coversation being awkward and bizarre. This truly benefits me especially after I entered college.</p>

                There are always myths lingering over Computer Science, which has been stamped them as the department of coding. Hence, before I entered college, I was not sure about whether I would like this major. Wondered and unsecured, I entered CS a year ago, which redefined my characteristic thoroughly. I attended a miscellaneous of courses in our department, which endows me the opportunity to savor the essence and beauty of Computer Science. I realized it is not only about coding, it focusses more on training us to have the ability to create and materialize our ideas.
                <br><br>
                Having the ability to communicate with computer is always fascinating, and this is the reason which drives me to keep improving my skills, be it on Front End or Back End. I am looking forward to join tech companies in future, and immerse myself in the hope of vision and advancement, which can, will, and must be accomplish with the help of computer.

                I love English, especially after participated international camps and studied the materials of my major. I came to realize that English is like an intangible line, which connects all the human and knowledge around the globe tightly. I hope to keep improving my English ability.

                I am eager to study abroad for my MS degree, for I always believe it would be a wonderful chance to acquaint different people around the world and immerse myself in a different educational environment.
