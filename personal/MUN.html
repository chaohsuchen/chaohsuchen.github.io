            <p>
                Like many of my fellow students, I was naturally introverted. However, I discovered that this trait was holding me back from making new friends and seizing opportunities for personal growth. Determined to overcome my shyness, I joined the Model United Nations club and was eventually chosen to represent France as a delegate. Through this experience, I gradually built up my confidence and developed a love for socializing with others. My hard work paid off when I was recognized with an award for <b>excellence in diplomacy</b>. As I continue on my journey of self-improvement, I am grateful for the chance to have pushed myself out of my comfort zone and become a more outgoing and confident person.

              	從前，我如多數的孩子一樣，是一位內向的孩子。但是，我逐漸發覺這種個性使我不容易交到朋友，甚至也因此錯失了許多能精進自己的機會。於是，當時的我下定決心，參加了模擬聯合國，擔任了法國代表。在一進一退之中，我學會應對進退的技巧，甚至愛上了交新朋友。最後，我很幸運地榮獲最佳外交獎，這項殊榮也成為我日後擁有外向性格的墊腳石。

                    <p>Through my participation in Model United Nations, I have honed my ability to converse and connect with new people without feeling uncomfortable or strange. This has been an invaluable asset, particularly as I have entered college and encountered many new and diverse individuals. The wisdom and confidence I have gained from MUN have allowed me to thrive in my personal and academic pursuits, and I am truly grateful for the growth and development that this experience has afforded me.</p>

                    因為參加了模擬聯合國，我建立起了與人們交談時的態度與方法，使得在與新朋友交談時，不會讓話題變得尷尬又無趣。這更幫助我在日後大學時快速地結交各系的朋友。
