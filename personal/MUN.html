            <p>
                Like many of my fellow students, I was naturally introverted. However, I discovered that this trait was holding me back from making new friends and seizing opportunities for personal growth. Determined to overcome my shyness, I joined the Model United Nations club and was eventually chosen to represent France as a delegate. Through this experience, I gradually built up my confidence and developed a love for socializing with others. My hard work paid off when I was recognized with an award for <b>excellence in diplomacy</b>. As I continue on my journey of self-improvement, I am grateful for the chance to have pushed myself out of my comfort zone and become a more outgoing and confident person.

                    <p>Through my participation in Model United Nations, I have honed my ability to converse and connect with new people without feeling uncomfortable or strange. This has been an invaluable asset, particularly as I have entered college and encountered many new and diverse individuals. The wisdom and confidence I have gained from MUN have allowed me to thrive in my personal and academic pursuits, and I am truly grateful for the growth and development that this experience has afforded me.</p>
