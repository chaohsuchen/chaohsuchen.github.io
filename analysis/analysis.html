            <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p>After describing the critical and hazardous issues of burning fire in the first paragraph in sec 1[<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], the author used the following highlighted sentence, in second paragraph, as the thesis statement. The reasons are that it strongly relates to the key phrases <q>How to save</q> in the topic, which indicates that there must be some solutions.</p>
            <p class="quote"><q>With climate change parching the land and increasing wildfire hazards,
                    <span style="background: #80cdc1;">scientists are beginning to use cutting-edge technology and computer modeling to make controlled, low-intensity burns safer, more effective and less disruptive to nearby communities.</span> "Fire has made us civilized, but we still don't understand it fully;' said Tirtha Banerjee of the University of California, Irvine, as he watched a tall heap of dead tree limbs go up in flames. As useful as prescribed burns can be for maintaining forests, they are tough to carry out一costly, labor-intensive, contingent on narrowing windows of favorable weather. And even well-planned burns can turn disastrous, as when a fire started by the United States Forest Service this spring was transformed by gusting winds into New Mexico's largest wildfire on record. .</q></p>

                    <p>This section has shed light on the difficulties of keeping forest fires under control by using key words such as <q>costly</q>, <q>labor-intensive</q> and <q>contingent on narrowing windows of favorable weather.</q></p>

                    <b>[<a href="example.html#sec2">Sec. #2</a>] - While people have used cutting-edge techniques to trace the behavior of wildfires, few have examined the specific questions related to prescribed fire.</b>
                    <p>Keywords and phrases such as <q>GoPro</q>, <q>drone-mounted sensors</q>, <q>sonic anemometer</q> and <q>an assortment of machines that collected airborne particles</q> all indicate that people are using advanced technology. In addition, quotes from Robert York had pointed out that real problem had not yet been solved. </p>

                <b>[<a href="example.html#sec3">Sec. #3</a>] - Despite the numerous catastrophes caused by wildfires, people remain unaware of the dangers of wildfires.</b>
                <p>The increasing levels of global warming make it more likely that a moderate wildfire will escalate into a deadly catastrophe. Therefore, it is important for people to study and explore prescribed fire as a means of preventing future wildfires from catching off guard. The keywords of this section could be boiled down to the following words. <q>Global warming </q>and <q>caught off guard.</q>

                <p>The Forest Service is developing a video game-like training system to help land managers learn how to safely conduct prescribed burns in increasingly volatile landscapes. This tool is necessary because the agency's current methods are not able to keep up with the challenges posed by a warming planet, and it will allow burn crew members to practice and prepare for various scenarios before implementing them in real life. The keyphrases are <q>the resulting fire proved more dangerous and fast moving than anticipated</q> and <q>Better fire modeling</q>.

                <p> The key phrases are <q>study how embers travel</q> and <q>analyze the chemical composition</q>. Because this paragraph is discussing the various methods that researchers at Blodgett Forest are using to study how fires spread and the chemical composition of fire emissions. It also mentions that this information is being used to evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed burns and to help land managers develop strategies for safely and effectively managing fires in the future. Therefore, the main idea or focus of the paragraph is the study of the behavior and effects of fires at Blodgett Forest.

                    <b>Para #1</b> This section is composed of just one paragraph, which connects it to the second paragraph of the first section by using the phrase <q>Scientists think we can do better.</q> The previous paragraph discussed how prescribed burns can be difficult and expensive to carry out and can also have negative impacts on air quality and local communities. Even well-planned burns can sometimes turn disastrous due to factors such as weather. Therefore, the opening of this sentence, <q>Scientists think we can do better</q> serves as a smooth transition. In addition, both sections also mention the difficulties of carrying out prescribed burns, including their <q>cost, labor intensity, and dependence on favorable weather conditions</q>, as well as the potential for even <q>well-planned burns to turn disastrous</q>.
                </li>

                    <b>Para #1</b> The sentence <q>advanced techniques</q> in the paragraph apply the technique of <b>synonyms/paraphrasing</b>, since the author lists out some of the equipment used by scientists in the previous sentences. Moreover, the author mentioned that <q>fewer people have looked at questions specific to prescribed fires</q>, and further gives an example like <q>whether debris should be cleared away with chain saws and bulldozers in advance</q>

In addition, the mention of <q>prescribed fires</q> and the use of <q>advanced techniques</q> to study wildfire behavior in section 2 is connected to the discussion of <q>thinning and the potential impacts</q> on fire behavior in this section.

                    <b>Para #2</b> <q>Better fire modeling is important, but so is turning that knowledge into easy-to-use tools for burn crews</q> relates to the previous paragraph's statement <q>The Forest Service has acknowledged that its methods are failing to keep up as the planet warms</q>, telling the reader how scientists think about the issue.

In the previous section, the author was discussing the research that scientists had done to have full control of the fire, and this section marks the start of the burn. Apart from the analysis above, the mention of research methods for analyzing <q>emissions</q> and the <q>effectiveness</q> of prescribed burns in section #5 is connected to the description of the actual prescribed burn at Blodgett Forest in this section.

            <h2>Take-home Message</h2>
            <p>
                In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author delivered the message again that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">prescribed burns is a practice used to prevent wildfires by intentionally setting controlled fires, can be both a natural and an artificial way </span>of protecting the land. This message is conveyed through the description of the burn and the observations and reflections of the scientists studying it. Additionally, the paragraph suggests that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">the study of science can be artistic and that the appreciation for this aspect of science may increase with age.</span> This is obtained by the quote <q>The older I get, the more I appreciate how much of science is like an art </q>from Dr. Randerson.
                <p class="quote"><q>For a while, the flames had a meek, almost dainty quality; the vegetation was too damp to bum very fiercely. But as the day warmed, fires began blackening the hillsides at a rapid clip. The scientists took in the scene cautiously as their machines gathered data. ►By late afternoon, Dr. York and his team had burned about 13 acres, and he sat down for a breather. His face was slick with sweat and grime. The forest smoldered all around him. Dr. Randerson took a moment to admire the brutal raw power of the fire they were studying - a natural, yet also unnatural way of safeguarding the land. "The older I get;' he said, "the more I appreciate how much of science is like an art.</q></p>
