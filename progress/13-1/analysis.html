            <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p>After describing the critical and hazardous issues of burning fire in the first paragraph in sec 1[<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], the author used the following highlighted sentence, in second paragraph, as the thesis statement. The reasons are that it strongly relates to the key phrases <q>How to save</q> in the topic, which indicates that there must be some solutions.</p>
            <p class="quote"><q>With climate change parching the land and increasing wildfire hazards,
                    <span style="background: #80cdc1;">scientists are beginning to use cutting-edge technology and computer modeling to make controlled, low-intensity burns safer, more effective and less disruptive to nearby communities.</span> "Fire has made us civilized, but we still don't understand it fully;' said Tirtha Banerjee of the University of California, Irvine, as he watched a tall heap of dead tree limbs go up in flames. As useful as prescribed burns can be for maintaining forests, they are tough to carry out一costly, labor-intensive, contingent on narrowing windows of favorable weather. And even well-planned burns can turn disastrous, as when a fire started by the United States Forest Service this spring was transformed by gusting winds into New Mexico's largest wildfire on record. .</q></p>

                    <p>This section had shed light on the difficulty of keeping forest fire under control by using the keywords such as <q>costly</q>, <q>labor-intensive</q> and <q>contingent on narrowing windows of favorable weather.</q></p>

                <p>Global warming level up the probability that a moderate wildfires evolving in deadly catastrophes. Therefore, people should explore and study prescribed fire, which could prevent us from being catching us off guard when encountering wildfires in future. The keywords of this section could be boiled down to the following words. <q>Global warming </q>and <q>caught off guard.</q>

                <li>
                    <b>Para #1 </b>- Section #2 is the first paragraph that follows the opening paragraph, so its first paragraph naturally carries on to elaborate on the main topic. In the first sentence <q>Early detection is key for intervention...</q>, the key phrase <q>Early detection</q> of dementia is linked back to the main topic of the essay, which creates a natural transition into the subtopic.

            <h2>Take-home Message</h2>
            <p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes the story of a participant taking part in the studies that investigate early indicators of dementia. In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects of understanding whether you have an early development of dementia. For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is <q>lower than the participant had feared</q>. The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding of the risk despite the need to share their personal data, like <q>I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not.</q> Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">there are more advantages than disadvantages to use your personal data to reveal your chance of having dementia and it's better to get fully prepared</span>.</p>
            <p class="quote"><q>Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. Alzheimer’s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother’s slow decline from the disease, he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. To Mr. Gondek’s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer’s by age 85 were about 19 percent — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared. If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, he said, “I would want to use them. I’d rather know than not.”</q></p>
